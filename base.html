	<h1>ScreenIT Report</h1>
	This is an automated report for _PAPER_ID_.
    <br><br>We are an independent group of scientists developing automated tools that analyze academic papers.
        A set of automated tools screened your preprint/submitted manuscript and provided the report below.
	Each tool was created by your academic colleagues with the goal of helping authors.
	The tools look for factors that are important for transparency, rigor and reproducibility,
	and we hope that the report might help you to improve reporting in your manuscript.
	Within the report you will find links to more information about the items that the tools check.
	These links include helpful papers, websites, or videos that explain why the item is important.
 	<br><br>The tools are not perfect and we apologize if they have missed something in your paper or screened
	for something that doesnâ€™t apply to the type of study that you performed.
	Each tool has limitations that are described on the ScreenIT website.
	The tools screen the main file for the paper; they are not able to screen supplements stored in separate files.
	<br><br>If you would like to reach out to us, please send us an email at ScreenIt@bih-charite.de.
